            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I help clients create and develop the websites and apps they need in their day-to-day lives. After graduating with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Journalism from Eastern Illinois University and obtaining certification in Full Stack Web Development from Northwestern University-Chicago Campus, I worked on and created multiple different projects utilizing a number of different coding languages including HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, and MongoDB/Mongoose.
            </p>
            <p>
              My technical skills combined with my experience in collaborative, deadline-driven environments make me a strong addition to any data analysis team. I have experience working in large and small scale teams, with either all team members present or working remotely. While not working on projects or repos on Github, I spend my time learning, practicing and updating my skills and languages.
